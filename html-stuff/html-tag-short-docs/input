HTML input element control. When used together with `ngModel`, it provides data-binding,
input state control, and validation.
Input control follows HTML5 input types and polyfills the HTML5 validation behavior for older browsers.

**Note:** Not every feature offered is available for all input types.
Specifically, data binding and event handling via `ng-model` is unsupported for `input[file]`.
