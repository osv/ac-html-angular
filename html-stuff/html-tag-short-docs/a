Modifies the default behavior of the html A tag so that the default action is prevented when
the href attribute is empty.
This change permits the easy creation of action links with the `ngClick` directive
without changing the location or causing page reloads, e.g.:
`<a href="" ng-click="list.addItem()">Add Item</a>`
