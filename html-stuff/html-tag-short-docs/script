Load the content of a `<script>` element into `$templateCache`, so that the
template can be used by `ngInclude`,
`ngView`, or directives. The type of the
`<script>` element must be specified as `text/ng-template`, and a cache name for the template must be
assigned through the element's `id`, which can then be used as a directive's `templateUrl`.
