`ngMessageExp` is a directive with the purpose to show and hide a particular message.
For `ngMessageExp` to operate, a parent `ngMessages` directive on a parent DOM element
must be situated since it determines which messages are visible based on the state
of the provided key/value map that `ngMessages` listens on.
