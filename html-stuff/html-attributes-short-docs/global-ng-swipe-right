Specify custom behavior when an element is swiped to the right on a touchscreen device.
A rightward swipe is a quick, left-to-right slide of the finger.
Though ngSwipeRight is designed for touch-based devices, it will work with a mouse click and drag
too.
Requires the `ngTouch` module to be installed.
