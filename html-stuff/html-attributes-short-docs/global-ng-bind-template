The `ngBindTemplate` directive specifies that the element
text content should be replaced with the interpolation of the template
in the `ngBindTemplate` attribute.
Unlike `ngBind`, the `ngBindTemplate` can contain multiple `{{` `}}`
expressions. This directive is needed since some HTML elements
(such as TITLE and OPTION) cannot contain SPAN elements.
