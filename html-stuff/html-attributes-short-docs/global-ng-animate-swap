ngAnimateSwap is a animation-oriented directive that allows for the container to
be removed and entered in whenever the associated expression changes. A
common usecase for this directive is a rotating banner component which
contains one image being present at a time. When the active image changes
then the old image will perform a `leave` animation and the new element
will be inserted via an `enter` animation.
