The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
as specified in the template.
The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
(where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
(or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
attribute is displayed.

Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
as literal string values to match against.
For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
