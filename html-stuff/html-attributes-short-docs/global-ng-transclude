Directive that marks the insertion point for the transcluded DOM of the nearest parent directive that uses transclusion.
You can specify that you want to insert a named transclusion slot, instead of the default slot, by providing the slot name
as the value of the `ng-transclude` or `ng-transclude-slot` attribute.
If the transcluded content is not empty (i.e. contains one or more DOM nodes, including whitespace text nodes), any existing
content of this element will be removed before the transcluded content is inserted.
If the transcluded content is empty, the existing content is left intact. This lets you provide fallback content in the case
that no transcluded content is provided.
