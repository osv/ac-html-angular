# ac-html-bootstrap.el

Angular completion data for EMACS `ac-html` and `company-web` modes.

## SETUP

Install `ac-html` if you use `auto-complete` completion framework
or `company-web` if you are using `company` framework.

When you edit your .html(.jade, .haml, .slim) file exec `M-x ac-html-angular+`
or `M-x company-web-angular+` to enable angular completion.

## ISSUES

Since `ac-html` 0.4 is alpha stage, and not stable yet. This package works with ac-html 0.3 series,
if you are using ac-html 0.4 series, you may downgrade `ac-html` aka reinstall from melpa-stable.

`ac-html` 0.4 will be supported in the future.
